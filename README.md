CDSMutSig is a R package containing a set of functions to map, given a protein, its coding DNA sequences, all possible amino acid substitutions as well as their corresponding DNA mutational contexts. This allows analysis of different protein-level consequences caused by different mutagenic processes.

## Installation

In R:

```
require(devtools)
install_github("josef0731/CDSMutSig")
```

## Usage

Please see [this vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/josef0731/CDSMutSig/blob/main/vignettes/CDSMutSig-vignette.html) for examples.
